            The “where” is hiding in plain sight: parking assets. 
            Already occupying some of the most valuable real estate in urban areas,
             parking has the centrality and capacity to house all of our mobility devices. 
        All parking needs to become the key to the smart city is a new mindset and the right 
        technology: a smart parking system that will raise the gate for more than just cars.   </p>

        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">This section, the literature review, mainly deals with the research conducted for the project in order to be able to get a better understanding regarding the problem, parking technologies and other related research.

            The main focus of the literature study has been assigned to the problem,
             which is the cruising for parking problem. Getting a better idea regarding 
             the problem will help build a more effective and efficient prototype. 
             The research was also conducted on current parking technologies that are being used in current days
              and any new technology which is being implemented to help reduce this problem.
               Another section is dedicated to proposed smart parking systems, this will help
                get an overview of how other researchers are tackling this problem. 
                Since the era of smart phone has increased considerably in today’s life some
                 research has been done to investigate how mobile phone applications are being
                  produced in order to help solve the cruising for parking problem.
                   Research regarding human computer interaction, reacTIVision, processing, 
                   TUIO library and image processing has also been conducted as
                    this will be useful for the prototype which will be built 
                    after gathering the researches.</p>
